              I've spent almost 3 years in Paris as of this writing. The question I get asked most often
              is whether I like the US or France more. My answer is always that it's just different.

              <br /><br /> 

              I believe a move to Europe, or anywhere, should be viewed as a series of trade-offs. You leave behind X, 
              but you have to adjust to Y. Neither X nor Y is correct, or better/worse, 
              it's just simply a different way of living. 
              Whether that trade-off makes sense to you depends on who you are and your current situation.

              <br /><br />
              
              I try to avoid platitudes here, and instead attempt to, for those <Link href="/about">like me</Link>, 
              cover the most stark trade-offs I experienced. I roughly group as below:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Lifestyle – Daily routine and pacing</li>
              <li>Career – Work culture, salaries, and hierarchy.</li>
              <li>Social Norms – Relationships, gender dynamics, and finding your people.</li>
              <li>Healthcare & Citizenship – Medical care and bureaucracy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>1. Social Norms</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Leave Behind:</strong> high intensity <br />
                <strong>Adjust To:</strong> low intensity <br /><br />

                In the States, it's always "what's the move." Festival, cool restaurant, dinner party, day trip, etc.
                The activiation energy in Europe is much higher for the same events, esp. when a chill apero 
                at your neighborhood cafe is a 3 minute walk and a 5 euro pint. <br /><br />

            <h2>2. Career</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Leave Behind:</strong> lead and hustle <br />
                <strong>Adjust To:</strong> follow and enjoy <br />
            </p>

            <h2>3. Healthcare & Citizenship</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Leave Behind:</strong> the ability to use technology<br />
                <strong>Adjust To:</strong> a new way of using technology <br />
            </p>    

            <h2>4. Arts and Culture</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Leave Behind:</strong> the ability to use technology<br />
                <strong>Adjust To:</strong> a new way of using technology <br />
